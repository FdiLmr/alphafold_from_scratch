# AlphaFold Clone from Scratch

This project is a from-scratch implementation of AlphaFold, DeepMind's breakthrough deep learning model for protein structure prediction. The aim of this project is to understand the architecture and methodology behind AlphaFold by recreating its components using Python and PyTorch.

## Project Overview

AlphaFold has revolutionized the field of bioinformatics by providing high-accuracy predictions of protein structures based on their amino acid sequences. This implementation focuses on understanding the core techniques used in AlphaFold, such as:
- **Attention Mechanisms**: The use of self-attention to model long-range dependencies in protein sequences.
- **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)**: Using evolutionary data to guide structure prediction.
- **3D Structure Prediction**: Using geometric constraints and embeddings to predict the final protein structure.

## Key Features

- **Data Processing and MSA Representation**: Extracts evolutionary features from input sequences to create an MSA representation.
- **Attention Layers**: Implements multi-head self-attention for capturing dependencies within sequences.
- **Geometric and Structural Embeddings**: Predicts 3D structures through geometric transformations and representations.
- **End-to-End Training Pipeline**: Trains the model using a simplified loss function designed for educational purposes.
